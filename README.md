Controllers and Routes:

Define routes for CRUD operations on each model (User, Course, Lesson, etc.).
Use resource controllers to handle operations.
Protect routes based on user roles (Student, Teacher, Admin) using Middleware.
Example routes:
api/users
api/courses
api/lessons
Services and Business Logic:

Implement service classes for handling complex business logic (e.g., course enrollment, attendance tracking).
Utilize Jobs for background processing (e.g., sending notifications).
Use Events and Listeners for real-time updates (e.g., exam results).
Phase 3: Frontend Development (Vue)
Component Structure:

Plan a modular component structure (e.g., Navbar, Sidebar, CourseList, LessonDetail).
Define Vue components using export default and data(). Components for:
User Dashboard (Admin, Teacher, Student views)
Course Management (create/edit courses, enroll students)
Timetable and Attendance
Payment integration (for subscription)
State Management (Pinia/Vuex):

Choose a state management solution (Pinia or Vuex) for managing global state.
Manage user authentication, roles, and data like courses, lessons, etc.
API Integration (Axios):

Use Axios for making HTTP requests to Laravel’s API.
Implement API calls for:
User authentication (login, register, logout)
CRUD operations (courses, lessons, assignments)
Subscriptions and payments
Phase 4: User Management and Authentication
Laravel Sanctum for API Authentication:

Implement Laravel Sanctum to handle API token authentication for Vue.
Protect API routes based on user roles (Admin, Teacher, Student).
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Define roles and permissions using middleware and policies.
Ensure different dashboards for each user role.
Phase 5: Course and Lesson Management
Course Creation and Enrollment:

Admin/Teacher should be able to create courses and manage enrollments.
Students can view and enroll in courses.
Lesson and Assignment Management:

Implement CRUD for lessons and assignments.
Allow teachers to post lessons, assignments, and exams.
Allow students to submit assignments and view grades.
Phase 6: Additional Features
Timetable and Attendance:

Admins and Teachers can manage the timetable.
Track student attendance and integrate with the timetable model.
Exams and Results:

Allow teachers to create exams and assign grades.
Students should be able to view exam results.
Phase 7: Payment and Subscription System
Subscription Management:
Use Stripe or PayPal for subscription-based access to school management.
Implement a subscription model in Laravel with Stripe integration.
Create middleware to restrict access based on subscription status.
Phase 8: Testing and Deployment
Testing:

Write unit tests and feature tests for critical functionality.
Use Laravel’s testing framework and Cypress (or Jest) for frontend testing.
Deployment:

Prepare the project for deployment (e.g., on Laravel Forge, Heroku, or DigitalOcean).
Ensure the environment is production-ready (optimizing Vue build, database migrations).
